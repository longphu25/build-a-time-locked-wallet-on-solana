# Build a Time-Locked Wallet on Solana

## Objective

Create a Solana smart contract and simple frontend for a Time-Locked Wallet:

- A user deposits SOL or USDC into a PDA account.
- Funds are locked until a specified unlock timestamp.
- After the unlock time, the user (or designated recipient) can withdraw the funds.

## Why It Matters

This is a basic building block for many on-chain use cases:

- Grants with release schedules
- DAO-controlled disbursements
- Trust funds or delayed payouts
- Parental wallets or time-based savings

## Deliverables

To qualify for the prize, your submission must include:

1. Solana Program (using Anchor)

   - Instruction: initialize_lock(amount, unlock_timestamp)
   - Instruction: withdraw()
   - Program owns a PDA account that holds the locked funds
   - Lock must be enforced on-chain (not just frontend)

2. Frontend

   - Form to create a time-locked wallet (input: amount + unlock time)
   - Display wallet state (amount locked, unlock date)
   - Button to withdraw if eligible (should fail if too early)
   - Works with Phantom or Backpack wallet

3. Public GitHub Repo

   - Program folder (Anchor)
   - Frontend folder (React or Svelte or HTML/JS)
   - README.md with clear instructions to run both
   - Optional: deploy to devnet and include test account/demo

## Bonus (Not Required)

Youâ€™ll earn bonus points if you:

- Use USDC (SPL token) instead of just SOL
- Add a countdown timer to unlock in the UI
- Write a simple test using Mocha/Chai or Anchor CLI
